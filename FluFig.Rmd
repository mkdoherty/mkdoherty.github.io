```{r setup, include=FALSE}
source('code/knitr_settings.R')
source('code/flufig/flufigure_byweeks.R')
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
pflu2
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
