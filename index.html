<p>Thanks for visiting. I am a Microbiologist interested in using data to gain insight about human and animal health, especially how we interact with the microbes living on and within us.</p>

<p>I earned my PhD in Microbiology at the <a href="https://mmg.ucdavis.edu/">University of California - Davis</a> researching antimicrobial therapeutics and resistance. In pursuit of my degree, I gained an appreciation for how big data, metabolomics, and genomics could be used to generate and test hypotheses. I also developed an interest in using these tools to learn about the human microbiome, especially following the diagnoses of friends and family with immune diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.</p>

<p>This led me to eventually join the lab of <a href="http://www.schlosslab.org/">Dr. Pat Schloss</a> within the <a href="https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/microbiology-immunology/">Department of Microbiology & Immunology</a> at the <a href="http://www.umich.edu">University of Michigan</a> <a href="https://medicine.umich.edu/medschool/">School of Medicine</a> as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow. We investigated the usefulness of the fecal microbiome as a biomarker for the successful treatment of Crohnâ€™s Disease (CD). Our findings are now published in the journal <a href="https://mbio.asm.org/content/9/2/e02120-17.abstract">mBio</a> and the code and data to generate this paper are available through <a href="https://github.com/SchlossLab/Doherty_CDprediction_mBio_2017">GitHub.</a></p>

<p>Since then, I have continued to develop programming and data analysis skills in order to find creative solutions for challenging problems within large datasets.</p>

<p>I'll be adding more links and content as I continue to update this page, so please come visit again soon and see what I've been doing!</p>
